Hey,
so this is an example of GUI built using webdev languages.
Basically it starts a webserver on port 8000 by using Chrome ( I think there's an option to use other browsers ).
You can use JS like usual and the cool thing is that you can integrate Python! You can access functions, libraries etc.
Currently I don't know how to do it. I've just set up this small app:
you run the python file in the terminal and it will do everything fo you.
The web files are in the "web" folder, we can change that tho.
I've noticed that closing Chrome doesn't actually stop the process in the terminal.
Let me know if you want to proceed with this lib! Will start looking at JS and HTML... dang I suck at those languages lmao.

INSTALL:
pip install eel
